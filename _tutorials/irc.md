- Server: `irc.freenode.net`
- Port: `6667` or `7000` for SSL
- Channel: `#osuosc`

There is no password to join the channel and anyone is welcome to come join and chat with us. Seeing as how this is an official channel we do have some rules presiding over behavior on our channel. We have a bot presiding over the channel and it will not hesitate to enforce these as well as common sense things, please just use common courtesy. You can register with our bot so that you will be added to the user database and you will also have access to some of the public commands that are available.

Please come join us in our channel! We are always open to anyone who just wants to come and chat about open source, or anything for that matter! If you are new to IRC in general, we maintain our own Linux machine with root access, so check out our article on how to connect to IRC. If you need to familiarize yourself with NickServ checkout [this](https://gist.github.com/brunowego/916d3412c8f59cad9c5a).

<!-- We keep chat logs from previous days. Just click the day you want to see and the log will pop up for your viewing pleasure. Club logs require an account on our site to view. -->
