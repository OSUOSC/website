In the summer of 2017 (exact date?) the club computer network failed.

Since then, we've been working to get it up and running again, and as you can see, the website is up and running.

## How did the website die?

- ETS pressed the power button.
- disk corruption, and as a result ...
	- LDAP is dead, and as a result ...
	- homedirs aren't served
	- user homedir websites as described at http://opsnsource.osu.edu/info/personal-sites/ are down
	- no mail
- no one can log into network machines including stallman and idle2

## What works now?

- The website

## What does the future hold?

We're working on things.

The last line of the post appears to be dropped somewhere in the parse, so I'm going to just put this comment here as the last line.
