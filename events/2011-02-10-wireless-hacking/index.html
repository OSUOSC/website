    <p>Tonight at 7 pm in <a href="http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=279">Dreese Labs</a> room 264, I, Michael Yanovich, will be covering various sub-topics to wireless hacking, however the main point that I want people to take away from this talk is how to secure your own wireless network from these types of attacks. I&rsquo;ll be covering a brief outline on how wireless networks work, the several types of encryption available, and other settings that can set to <strong>try</strong> to protect your network. I&rsquo;ll be demonstrating these attacks as well, and I&rsquo;ll be needing help in this endeavor and I encourage people to bring their laptops if they wish to participate. I encourage people to follow along and learn the most they can about wireless security. I&rsquo;m bringing my own equipment for us to attack and I&rsquo;m giving permission to those who attend to help out and to help show off the weakness of various types or security implementations that I will be covering. I also have surprise raw data information about wifi access points in the Columbus area that will definitely be interesting!</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: We do not encourage the use of any of the software and/or techniques to use be used on any equipment besides equipment that you either own or are given permission explicitly from the owner of said equipment. Also we are <strong>NOT</strong> responsible for the actions people take using these techniques learned at this meeting. All information that is being taught is very <strong>easily</strong> accessible on the Internet. I&rsquo;m asking those who participate come prepared with the software installed if possible. I know this is late notice but it won&rsquo;t take more than a few minutes of your time. You can participate in helping me produce information on any system but if you want to follow through with what I&rsquo;ll be doing you&rsquo;ll need a laptop with Linux.</p>
<p>There are only two packages they you need: aircrack-ng and &ldquo;john the ripper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aircrack-ng is available in almost any linux distribution repository. I know it&rsquo;s available in Ubuntu&rsquo;s and Fedora&rsquo;s repositories. However, for &ldquo;john the ripper&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll need to download and compile it for your laptop. You can find it here: <a href="http://www.openwall.com/john/g/john-1.7.6.tar.gz">http://www.openwall.com/john/g/john-1.7.6.tar.gz</a></p>
<p>More information in general about John The Ripper: <a href="http://www.openwall.com/john/">http://www.openwall.com/john/</a></p>
<p>If you want walk through what I&rsquo;ll be covering, please come prepared (if possible, with the software installed and ready to go). If you have any trouble respond to the email or catch us on IRC and we&rsquo;ll help you out.</p>
