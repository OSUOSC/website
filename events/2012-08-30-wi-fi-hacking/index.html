<p>I, Michael Yanovich, will be covering Wi-Fi Hacking on 2012/08/30 at 7:00pm (20120830T1900-0400 for those who love ISO8601 compliant dates) in Dreese Labs 266. What I want people to walk away from this talk with is the knowledge of how to <em>try</em> to protect their Access Points (AP) the best they can with currently available technology. I will start off with a basic introduction into simple Electricity and Magnetism (E&M) and quickly move into some of the layers of the OSI Model of networking involved. The bulk of the talk will be a live demonstration of testing the security of WEP and WPA (1 and 2). I encourage people to follow along and learn the most they can about wireless security. I&rsquo;m bringing my own equipment for us to attack and I&rsquo;m giving permission to those who attend to help out and to help show off the weakness of various types of security implementations that I will be demonstrating. I also have surprise raw data information about wifi access points in the Columbus area that will definitely be a treat!</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: We do not encourage the use of any of the software and/or techniques to be used on any equipment besides equipment that you either own or are given explicit permission from the owner of said equipment. Also we are NOT responsible for the actions people take using these techniques learned at this meeting. All information that is being taught is very easily available on the Internet via your favourite search engine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking those who participate come prepared with the software installed if possible. You can participate in helping me produce information on any system but if you want to follow through with what I&rsquo;ll be doing you&rsquo;ll need a laptop with Linux. Also, please try to get aircrack-ng installed before the meeting, as the software will not work with any wireless card available in any laptop. So, there is a chance you may not be able to do these attacks with the given software.</p>
<p>There are only two packages they you need: aircrack-ng and &ldquo;john the ripper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aircrack-ng is available in almost any linux distribution repository. I know it&rsquo;s available in Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora&rsquo;s repositories. However, for &ldquo;john the ripper&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll need to download and compile it for your laptop. You can find it here: <a href=http://www.openwall.com/john/g/john-1.7.6.tar.gz>http://www.openwall.com/john/g/john-1.7.6.tar.gz</a></p>
<p>For more information about John The Ripper: <a href=http://www.openwall.com/john/>http://www.openwall.com/john/</a>
For more information about aircrack-ng: <a href=http://www.aircrack-ng.org/>http://www.aircrack-ng.org/</a></p>
<p>If you want walk through what I&rsquo;ll be covering, please come prepared (if possible, with the software installed and ready to go). If you have any trouble respond to the email or catch us on IRC (<a href=irc://irc.libera.chat/osuosc>#osuosc</a> on <a href=https://libera.chat/>Libera</a> and we&rsquo;ll help you out.</p>
<p>UPDATE: 2012/09/22 &ndash; The presentation used during the talk is now available on this page. Don&rsquo;t forget that in addition to files being hosted here, they are also available at my personal website, <a href=https://yanovich.net/.public/wifi/>https://yanovich.net/.public/wifi/</a></p>
