      <p>This Thursday, 2015/04/23 at 7:00PM in Caldwell Labs 120, Daniel Thau
will present a tour of Vim functionality.  Prior Vim experience is not
required.  This presentation will aim to cover things at a high-level in
order to cover a broad number of Vim subsystems.  This is done in the
hopes of getting to new topics not covered in previous OSC Vim
presentations.  However, but if requested the presenter can go into
further detail on any of the discussed items - do not hesitate to speak
up and ask for further detail.  A list of <code class="highlighter-rouge">:help</code>-able items will be
provided after the presentation to reference to minimize the need for
note-taking.</p>

I’ll detail some of the more interesting things you can do with Postgres during my talk - including using it as a search engine, as a GIS database, and as a social media client.

      <p>Update on the stallman2 migration:</p>

<p>It’s happening! The largest of the remaining tasks has been completed and we’re almost all set to go. Downtime will be scheduled this Friday starting at 3pm until I have no clue when as we do a final sync of the data, physically move the hardware, and verify that everything is operating correctly.</p>

<p>Since stallman2 is a fresh start, it may not have all the software that stallman currently has. I’ll try to install some commonly used software, but if there’s something specific you want please email me at osler.6 to request it. Especially if you’d like a DE other than Unity or i3, since that’s all that’s installed so far.</p>

<p>Please note that the new machine will be Ubuntu 14.04 (from 12.04) and will be 64 bit (from 32 bit).</p>

<p>Eli and I will be giving an introduction to web development using Ruby on Rails. Ruby is an open source programming language that first surfaced in the 90’s, and gained popularity through it’s expressive syntax and powerful features, such as metaprogramming. The Rails web development framework is written in Ruby, and is known for allowing developers to iterate extremely quickly. To illustrate this point, we intend to build a functional (though perhaps unstyled) blog in a fraction of the time it would take to write in another language or framework.</p>

      <p>This Thursday, 2014-11-06 in Caldwell Labs 120, John Simerlink will present his project “Intellidu”. His blurb follows:</p>

<p>Basically I’m building an education platform with a few friends that heavily uses data analytics and A/B testing to allow teacher to iteratively improve their courses. Teachers or uses will be able to empirically test out educational psychology research and apply them into any course imaginable.</p>

<p>“Intellidu”: Our app is designed to make you learn the quickest possible in any subject.</p>

<p>Our app will let you learn up to 2x faster, by spacing your content for review at just the right time, be it Spanish flashcards or algebra exercises. This means you aren’t studying too much or too little. This is known as Spaced Repetition.</p>

<p>Anyone can create courses on our app. Likewise, through a process similar to Wikipedia, anyone can edit/ make suggestions to courses to make them better, following a set of standards developed from education research.</p>

<p>Course creators can optimize their courses through experiments. If Jim creates a Spanish course, he could assign a small portion of his users to a different version of his course, to see if that variation of the course makes students learn quicker.</p>

<p>We will host other features that make you learn as fast as possible, such as gamification (making learning like a video game) and course integration (you won’t have to be retaught the same content you learned in another course)</p>

<p>You will be able to study any subject on your computer or mobile device, for example chemistry through handwriting recognition on your tablet.</p>

<p>We plan to be FREE and open-source.</p>

<p>We plan to have a Beta Release of our minimum viable product this December</p>

<p>The KEY FEATURE is that we time how long it takes each user to learn each fact. This forms the foundation of our app, letting any developer or researcher come along to test if their teaching or studying method lets people learn quicker.</p>

<p>Initial project/”Minimum Viable Product”:</p>

<p>Simply a flashcard web app, that has a timer in the background tracking how long it takes you to learn each piece of information.</p>

<p>We’re going to be open source, and within a few months will be reaching out to people to join along. We are also going to register as a nonprofit.</p>

      <p>Thursday, 2014-10-30 at 7:00pm in Caldwell Labs 120, Jon Arnett will present Elixir. Description follows:</p>

<p>From the metaphorical ashes of the mostly-forgotten language Erlang, arises a promising successor, Elixir. With an intuitive syntax inherited from Ruby, Elixir takes the power of Erlang, and makes it accessible to even novice programmers. Elixir includes all of the most impressive features from it’s predecessor, such as the functional paradigm, hot-swapping of code, and fault-tolerance or the “let it crash” philosophy. In this talk, I will cover the basics of Elixir, including syntax and data structures, and a brief overview of Elixir’s build tool, Mix, as well as covering some of the philosophies that contributed to the formation of the language.</p>
