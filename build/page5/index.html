<p>The year is 2014: home theater PCs are all but extinct… or are they? This talk will help you reinvigorate your media collection with a home media center, complete with intranet access and a killer frontend. We’ll cover some of the fun of Plex, XBMC, and MythTV. As a bonus, we’ll even show you what you can do with using a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>After this talk, you should be able to breathe some life into all that music and video, all using free software!</p>

      <p>Hi everyone!</p>

<p>This Thursday, 2014-10-09 in Caldwell Labs 120, The Open Source Club at The Ohio State University will present Personal Projects.</p>

<p>This series of lightning talks will give an opportunity for members of The Open Source Club to show off the stuff that they’ve been making, whether at hackathons or in their spare time. Even class projects can be interesting.</p>

<p>The talk format is open to everyone, but if you want to 100% reserve space email meetings@opensource.osu.edu.</p>

      <p>This Thursday, 2014-10-02 in Caldwell Labs 120, William Osler will present Zimbra: Open Source Mail &amp; Groupware. Description follows.</p>

<p>Email has been the core of how we communicate via the internet for longer than some of us have been alive, but in modern times can involve a complex interaction between various systems to get your message from point A to point B. But it doesn’t have to be hard. I’ll be going over Zimbra, an open source mail and groupware solution that you can host and run yourself. With the right server and a domain name, you can take control of your email, calendar, contacts and files and have the convenience of “the cloud” without the PRISM.</p>

<p>I will be doing a live demo of setup during this meeting, and you can follow along if you have previous GNU/Linux experience. You’ll need a VPS with at least 2 GB of memory running Ubuntu 12.04 and a domain name set up and pointing to the box. You can download the necessary files ahead of time at http://www.zimbra.com/downloads/zimbra-collaboration-open-source</p>

      <p>Thursday, 2014/09/25 at 7:00pm in Caldwell Labs 120, Alex Fuhr will present Pure Data. Pure Data is an open source, minimal, and visual programming language for audio, graphic, and signal processing. This talk will start by covering the basic building blocks of the language, then dive deeper into the following topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Audio and waveform generation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The “data flow” model of communication</p>

      <p>This Thursday, 2014/09/11 at 7pm, in Caldwell Labs 120, Chris Wallace will present Wireless Security. In this talk, we will discuss different ways of penetrating wireless access points with the goal of explaining how security works in a wifi world. The takeaway from this is that, once you’re out there, you should be able to protect your wifi as best as possible. This talk is intended to be interactive, which means that there will be an access point on location that we’ll be attempting to gain access to. This talk is also intended to be informative, which means that we’ll be discussing some of the different types of authentication out there in the world.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: We do not encourage the use of any of the software and/or techniques to be used on any equipment besides equipment that you either own or are given explicit permission from the owner of said equipment. Also we are NOT responsible for the actions people take using these techniques learned at this meeting. All information that is being taught is very easily available on the Internet via your favorite search engine.</p>

<p>I reiterate, <b>DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, DO THIS ON ANY EQUIPMENT YOU DO NOT OWN OR DO NOT HAVE EXPRESS WRITTEN PERMISSION TO DO SO.</b></p>

<p>In order to get the most from this talk, it helps to come with the software preinstalled. There are only two packages they you need: aircrack-ng and “john the ripper.”</p>

<p>Aircrack-ng is available in almost any linux distribution repository. I know it’s available in Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora’s repositories. However, for “john the ripper” you’ll need to download and compile it for your laptop. You can find it here: http://www.openwall.com/john/g/john-1.7.6.tar.gz</p>

<p>For more information about John The Ripper: http://www.openwall.com/john/
For more information about aircrack-ng: http://www.aircrack-ng.org/</p>

<p>If you want walk through what I’ll be covering, please come prepared (if possible, with the software installed and ready to go). If you have any trouble respond to the email or catch us on IRC (#osuosc on freenode) and we’ll help you out.</p>

<p>Matt was one of the leaders of the DESCHALL project that cracked a message encrypted with the then-US-Government-Standard 56-bit DES using idle cycles of computers connected over the Internet. His book, Brute Force: Cracking the Data Encryption Standard, is the memoir of that project, and the presentation will give an inside look into one of the largest computations ever performed, forcing a change in US policy, and looking back and seeing how what happened then relates to the present policy issues regarding the relationship between the government and its citizenry online.</p>

<p>This will be our last official meeting of the 2013-2014 academic year, so we will do a goodbye to seniors.</p>

      <p>Thursday, 2014/04/17 at 7:00pm in Caldwell Labs 120, Owen King of the Department of Philosophy will present: Anti-features, Free and Open Source Software, and Ethics.</p>

<p>Abstract:
DRM, spyware, adware, crippleware, backdoors.  What do all these have in common?  For starters, we usually prefer that they not be included in our software.  More specifically, we can say that these are all examples of anti-features.  Unfortunately, most ways people have tried to define ‘anti-feature’ have been inadequate in some way.  My first task, then, is to develop a clear, careful definition of an anti-feature. Next, I turn to the question of whether free and open-source software (FOSS) is compatible with anti-features.  The answer, perhaps surprisingly, is a qualified yes.  My third task is to explain why anti-features exist in the first place, and why it is usually a bad thing. In fact, it is often immoral for a programmer to implement an anti-feature.  Finally, I explain why FOSS can be a user’s best defense against anti-features.</p>

Bedrock Linux is a Linux distribution founded by Daniel with the aim of making most of the (often seemingly mutually-exclusive) benefits of various other Linux distributions available simultaneously and transparently. For example, if one would like a rock-solid stable base (for example, from Debian or a RHEL clone) yet still have easy access to cutting-edge packages (from, say, Arch Linux), Bedrock will provide a means to achieve this.</p>

In order to get out there, the Open Source Club will have carpooling from Caldwell Labs to Tech Columbus, meaning:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>At 6:30-6:45 we will leave from the back entrance of Caldwell (near CL120 where we normally meet)
At 9:00 we will leave TechColumbus and return everyone to Caldwell Labs
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you would like to help carpool, bring your car to the back entrance of Caldwell at 6:30.
The Address is:
  TechColumbus
  1275 Kinnear Rd,
  Columbus, OH 43212</p>

<p>Additionally: TechColumbus is about a 5 minute walk from the Carmack 4 bus stop on west campus. If you for some reason cannot get a ride with us, feel free to use the CABS bus system instead.</p>

<p>There will be pizza.</p>
