The following is a brief excerpt on Von Neumann machines from Jon Arnett:“Imagine a probe gliding through the galaxy. It lands on a planet, and begins to mine. After a while, it uses the materials it has collected to construct a replica of itself. The replica launches into space. The original probe sets off to explore its new found world, sending data back to Earth.Imagine a nanobot breathing in carbon dioxide and breathing out oxygen. Overwhelmed by the sheer amount of gas it must convert, it creates a replica to help it create a breathable atmosphere.Imagine a world that’s gray. It undulates, slightly. If you were to take a microscope and look very closely (cautiously, though), you would see a teeming civilization of nanobots. They have overrun. They have eaten everything. They will eat you, too, if you get too close.These are the promises and perils of Von Neumann (or Self-Replicating) machines. Join me for my exploration of this field, focusing on the history and theory of such machines.”As always there will be pizza and laptops are encouraged.–"},{"title":"Wikipedia in your next project","category":"","tags":"announcements","url":"/announcements/2016/11/15/wikipedia-in-your-next-project/","date":"11/15/2016","content":"Kevin Payravi from Wikipedia Connection will present on how to incorporate Wikipedia and its sister projects into your next project.

Ruby is an open source programming language that first surfaced in the 90’s, and gained popularity through it’s expressive syntax and powerful features, such as metaprogramming. The Rails web development framework is written in Ruby, and is known for allowing developers to iterate extremely quickly.

Teachers or uses will be able to empirically test out educational psychology research and apply them into any course imaginable.“Intellidu”: Our app is designed to make you learn the quickest possible in any subject.Our app will let you learn up to 2x faster, by spacing your content for review at just the right time, be it Spanish flashcards or algebra exercises. This means you aren’t studying too much or too little. This is known as Spaced Repetition.Anyone can create courses on our app. Likewise, through a process similar to Wikipedia, anyone can edit/ make suggestions to courses to make them better, following a set of standards developed from education research.Course creators can optimize their courses through experiments. If Jim creates a Spanish course, he could assign a small portion of his users to a different version of his course, to see if that variation of the course makes students learn quicker.We will host other features that make you learn as fast as possible, such as gamification (making learning like a video game) and course integration (you won’t have to be retaught the same content you learned in another course)You will be able to study any subject on your computer or mobile device, for example chemistry through handwriting recognition on your tablet.We plan to be FREE and open-source.We plan to have a Beta Release of our minimum viable product this DecemberThe KEY FEATURE is that we time how long it takes each user to learn each fact. This forms the foundation of our app, letting any developer or researcher come along to test if their teaching or studying method lets people learn quicker.Initial project/”Minimum Viable Product”:Simply a flashcard web app, that has a timer in the background tracking how long it takes you to learn each piece of information.We’re going to be open source, and within a few months will be reaching out to people to join along.

What do all these have in common?  For starters, we usually prefer that they not be included in our software.  More specifically, we can say that these are all examples of anti-features.  Unfortunately, most ways people have tried to define ‘anti-feature’ have been inadequate in some way.  My first task, then, is to develop a clear, careful definition of an anti-feature. Next, I turn to the question of whether free and open-source software (FOSS) is compatible with anti-features.  The answer, perhaps surprisingly, is a qualified yes.  My third task is to explain why anti-features exist in the first place, and why it is usually a bad thing. In fact, it is often immoral for a programmer to implement an anti-feature.  Finally, I explain why FOSS can be a user’s best defense against anti-features.As always, there will be pizza."},{"title":"Open Source Hardware (Arduino)","category":"","tags":"announcements,, embedded","url":"/announcements/2014/03/28/open-source-hardware-arduino/","date":"03/28/2014","content":"Thursday, April 3rd at 7:00PM in Caldwell Labs (CL) 120, Ben Rhoads will present Arduino and Open-Source Hardware.

So long as the requirements of the Ohio State University and the realistic needs of the club are met, efforts should be made to minimize bureaucracy.As the club has evolved it has become necessary to elect additional officers in order to aid the further growth of the club. While this is not an attempt to create a bureaucracy, it is necessary in order to delegate duties among members in order to help the club run smoothly. At the time of this writing there are currently three elected positions within the club: President (or Benevolent Dictator), Vice President, and Treasurer. These three positions will continue to exist as long as they are required by the Ohio State University.Article I - Name, Purpose and Non-Discrimination PolicySection 1 - NameThis is the Opensource Club at the Ohio State University.Section 2 - PurposeOur purpose is to write and advocate free software, and to create acommunity of excellent programmers. We advocate free software throughcreation of documentation, providing support, and fighting cluelessness.The club should take no “official” stand on political issues in debateamong the open source community, should adopt no “official clublicense,” should not create strict guidelines for what kind of softwareshould be developed, should not create strict guidelines for how asoftware project should be managed (including frequency of updates,release models, code repository management, etc). Doing so would violatethe spirit of the Preamble. Individual software projects can be managedhowever the individuals involved in the project see fit.Implicit in this is that the club must allow advocacy of proprietarysoftware written for opensource platforms (for instance) or writing ofopen source software for a proprietary platform (for instance) if someof its members wish to do so. However, programs written by members ofthe club, under the flag of the club, and distributed by the club shouldmeet some acceptable definition of open source software.Section 3 - Non Discrimination PolicyIn recognition of the importance of welcoming diversity for the sake ofcreativity, and for the benefit of humanity, this club welcomes allpeople. This means that our club and it’s members will not discriminateagainst any individual(s) for reasons of age, color, disability, genderidentity or expression, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexualorientation, or veteran status.Article II - Membership: Qualifications and categories of membershipPart 1 - Membership Categories and Selection ProcessesOhio State University guidelines demand that voting membership belimited to currently enrolled students. In order to meet thisrequirement, membership will be divided into voting and non-votingcategories.      Non-voting membership can be obtained simply by attendance ofmeetings or presence on our mailing list.        Voting membership requires that the individual meet all Ohio StateUniversity guidelines for voting membership, and that the individualhas attended at least one meeting prior to the vote.  Part 2 - Membership PrivilegesAccounts on the club computers can be given out to any member whorequests an account, provided Ohio State University’s rules arefollowed. These accounts may be revoked due to inactivity or failure tofollow the rules. Key card access to the club office can be grantedon request given the consent of the president, provided that Ohio State University rules are followed. Access may be revoked due to inactivity or failure to follow the rules. When it is necessary to take a vote, voting members are allowed to do so.Part 3 - Membership RemovalShould cause for membership removal be raised, a member can be removedin one of two ways:      A majority vote of club officers.        A two thirds majority vote of voting members, providing there is at least a week’s notice of the vote.  Article III - Officer Positions, Duties, Selection, and RemovalPart 1 - Officer Positions, Duties, Powers and Limitations.There are three officer positions required by the Ohio State University: The President (or BenevolentDictator), the Vice President, and the Treasurer. These three positionswill continue to exist as long as they are required by the Ohio StateUniversity. The responsibilities of the aforementioned officers are asfollows:The President shall have the following responsibilities:      Managing key card access to the office        Assignment of administrative accounts on the club computers        Securing the meeting location        Announcing meeting location and topic        Representing the club at other functions and in public        Appointment of miscellaneous positions  The Vice President shall have the following responsibilities:      Keeping the minutes of the meeting        Carrying out the duties of the President when the President isunable to do so  The Treasurer shall the following responsibilities:      Produces and presents a quarterly budget        Purchases pizza and other consumables for meetings        Represents our club at E-Council        Produces and Submits applications for funding  All of these responsibilities may be delegated to other club members,though they are ultimately the responsibility of the aforementionedofficers. The President will probably be the hardest working member ofthe club, and therefore needs the power to make unilateral decisions forthe sake of saving time. No officer will necessarily have any controlover software projects, since by the definition of opensource software,code forks can happen when they need to, and no one therefore hasultimate power over a software project.Part 2 - Officer SelectionOnce a year, elections will take place for the officer positions. Thiselection must be announced at least one week prior to the vote. Anyvoting member who meets The Ohio State University’s requirements may runfor any of the offices excluding extra positions that are designated as being appointed (see III 1). The individual who receives the most votes willattain that position for the next academic year, unless removed. Tieswill be broken by a vote of the officers in place before the activeelection.Part 3 - Officer RemovalLeadership is needed in any club and so officers are required to bepresent at eight out of 10 official meetings per quarter, whileit is also realized that extenuating circumstances are possible. Inorder to eliminate doubts surrounding an officers excuse for missing ameeting, said officer must notify at least one of the other officersthat they will not be in attendance at least 24 hours in advance. If anofficer is in violation of the aforementioned attendance rules, then theclub members will take a vote as to whether or not said officer will beallowed to keep his or her position. For all other cases of misconduct,the officer will face the same removal process as any other member ofthe club.Article IV - Advisor: Qualification CriteriaThe advisor should be a person of technical experience. Preferablysomeone who has been involved in Opensource development. The advisormust grok the goals of the club so that he or she does not get in theirway. The advisor exists to provide guidance, mentor-ship, andcluefulness. The advisor’s term is one academic year.University guidelines demand that the advisor (or failing that, thesub-advisor) “of student organizations must be full-time members of theUniversity faculty or Administrative &amp;amp; Professional staff.”Article V - Meetings of the OrganizationIt should be recognized that those involved in individual softwareprojects will have meetings separate from the meetings of rest of theclub. It is encouraged, however, that all club members be invited tothese meetings.If none of the officers of the club can be in attendance at a givenmeeting then said meeting will not take place, as decisions cannot bemade without the presiding officers. Members can still hold anindependent meeting, but it will not be recognized as an official clubmeeting.Article VI - Method of Amending Constitution: Proposals, notices and voting requirementsIn the case that someone thinks that they need to alter the constitutionor by-laws (if any) for bug fixes, adding features, or compatibilitywith new hardware, the election must be announced at least a week in advance and the vote must be a 2/3 majority. Voting can be in person or via someelectronic medium provided that in either case a reasonable amount ofcertainty of identity can be secured. Amendments and changes should betaken advisedly and considered for a reasonable amount of time beforebeing implemented.It is strictly discouraged that the constitution should be amendedfrequently. If it is to be amended, and by-laws do not exist, this thisarticle (article VI) allows the creation of by-laws in favor of amendingthe main body of the constitution (this document).It is further strictly discouraged that any amendments or by-lawsrestricting free commerce and creativity be created. New amendments orby-laws should not conflict with the above stated purpose of the club.Article VII - Method of Dissolution of OrganizationShould the club be forced to dissolve itself, any and all assets shouldbe put toward the club’s debt (if any). This includes university ownedequipment or university funds.The remaining assets (hardware, operating funds, etc) should be donatedto a free software organization, like the fsf. The organization to whichthe assets are donated must be determined at the time of dissolution bythe Benevolent Dictator, with approval of the supervisor."},{"title":"Bedrock Linux","category":"","tags":"announcements,, bedrock,, linux,, os","url":"/announcements/2014/03/24/bedrock-linux/","date":"03/24/2014","content":"This Thursday, May 27th at 7:00PM in Caldwell Labs (CL) 120, Daniel Thau and Brad Hollander will present Bedrock Linux.

It utilizes a terminal to render its interface, but is crisp and clean with how it presents information. To install, first get WeeChat from your distribution’s package manager. After installation, start weechat from the command line with$ weechat-cursesand watch it fire up!To get connected to freenode, type the following into weechat/connect irc.freenode.netYou may need to set your name as other users see it, which can be done with/nick yourDesiredNickAfter you are fully connected to freenode, join any room you like with/join #osuoscRunning WeeChat with screenTo idle with WeeChat, that is, keep your chat session open without ever leaving, one utility that can be used is screen.

While there exist countless IRC clients for countless platforms this talk is going to focus on using IRC from a GNU/Linux machine that is left on 24/7, “dedicated”, so that one can SSH into the machine (from Windows, Mac and GNU/Linux) and pull up their session the way they left it. This is often called “idling” and most people on the larger IRC networks often “idle”. The software combination that will be described in detail for this talk is WeeChat and tmux.

There will be no slides and this will be a live demonstration of how to set up WeeChat and tmux on the GNU/Linux distribution Debian 6 “Squeeze”.Preparations: You can install tmux through most package managers on most GNU/Linux distributions. WeeChat should be downloaded and compiled from source to obtain the latest version, 0.4.0 (which was released this past Sunday, 2013/01/20). The compilation of WeeChat will briefly be demonstrated.Students: The OSUOSC offers access to a system designed specifically for “idling”. You must be a student to request access and access can only be given in person. Please contact an officer of the club today for more information!Afterwards: There will be a PGP signing party after the IRC meeting. If you would like to participate please bring a piece of paper with necessary information to sign your key (full name, e-mail address associated with your key, key ID and/or your key fingerprint, and where to obtain your public key), as we will only be exchanging papers for the signing party. Also, please bring at least one government issued photo identification with you if you would like others to sign your PGP key, individual members may have more strict requirements for signing your PGP key. If you have any questions please feel free to contact us. Additionally, we will go over how to create a PGP key during this segment."},{"title":"The Command Line","category":"","tags":"announcements,, cli,, terminal,, bash,, shell","url":"/announcements/2013/01/14/the-command-line/","date":"01/14/2013","content":"Hello everyone!This Thursday, January 17th, at 7pm in Dreese Lab 369, Brad Hollander will be presenting The Command Line.

What I want people to walk away from this talk with is the knowledge of how to try to protect their Access Points (AP) the best they can with currently available technology. I will start off with a basic introduction into simple Electricity and Magnetism (E&amp;amp;M) and quickly move into some of the layers of the OSI Model of networking involved. The bulk of the talk will be a live demonstration of testing the security of WEP and WPA (1 and 2). I encourage people to follow along and learn the most they can about wireless security. I’m bringing my own equipment for us to attack and I’m giving permission to those who attend to help out and to help show off the weakness of various types of security implementations that I will be demonstrating.

So, there is a chance you may not be able to do these attacks with the given software.There are only two packages they you need: aircrack-ng and “john the ripper.”Aircrack-ng is available in almost any linux distribution repository. I know it’s available in Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora’s repositories. However, for “john the ripper” you’ll need to download and compile it for your laptop.

The older channel is currently setup to forward people over to the newer channel. This was done for several reasons, a few of which are to make our channel name match up with the cloaks we provide (more about how freenode operates), and simplify the channel name. A few new things you may notice, besides the name, are that everyone is +v (voiced) upon joining the channel and a few new modes set. The voice is a work around for those who the IRCd may consider typing too fast or pasting anything more than a few lines. Also those with the @osuosc/* cloaks are +e and +I’ed on the room. The +e means that those with the cloaks are exempt from any bans or quiets, and the +I means that those with the cloaks can join if the room becomes +i for any reason in the future (even if temporarily). The ACL (Access Control List) remains the same from the previous room, /msg ChanServ access #osuosc list. For an explanation of all the channel modes set at any give time you can pull up help in two places: /quote help cmode or freenode’s guide to “Using the network”. (Note the /quote command also works for user modes too, /quote help umode.) Also at this time the channel #osuosc-ops was created for those who have privileges on #osuosc to handle any type of dispute that may arise in the future from a ban. This channel will primarily be for handling any type of disputes that may arise from a ban or any other channel management. This channel is logged for internal use of the ops.

If the date does not work for you and you are a voting club member (ie, you are a student and have attended at least one meeting prior to the vote), please contact the club offers as soon as possible and we will see what we can do. Three positions need to be filled. More details about the responsibilities of each member can be found in the club constitution on our web page.  President: Primary responsibility is to ensure a meeting place and topic is set.  Vice President: Keep the minutes and fill in for the President when he or she is unavailable.  Treasurer: Manage club funds (and order pizza)Historically the club has had other positions (which are not officially recognized by the university):  Webmaster: manages the club website.  E-council representative: Attends e-council meetings. Usually appointed by the Treasurer.As is evident from the tone of our club constitution, the club’s original founders seemed to intend for it to be reasonable laid back; none of these positions should be overly stressful. Worst case scenario is the club website has some downtime, the club misses some free pizza, we have to fumble to find a new room, and have to wing a conversation rather than having a pre-set presentation. In addition to the election, Daniel “paradigm” Thau will present the LaTeX markup language. LaTeX is a markup language used by many Mathematicians, Scientists, and Engineers which is particularly capable at typesetting Mathematics. Finally, a reminder: Mothers day is Sunday, May 13th.

This presentation primarily will focus basic tools including but not limited to cloning/healing, layer masking, fine selections, and basic image transformations. To demonstrate that GIMP is on the same playing field as other proprietary and expensive image editors, some more advanced techniques may also be discussed if time allows. The talk is interactive, and use of a laptop with GIMP already installed is encouraged, but no prior experience with image editors is necessary. Nonetheless, the talk shall be informative for even experienced image editors.Although past presentations have focused on advanced editing, a foundational understanding of the basic tools is essential to understand those techniques. In the past, many guests saw how to perform some advanced edit, but walked away not understanding the basic tools were ultimately unable to replicate what they saw. Therefore, this talk will be aimed at somebody who has never opened GIMP before, and provide the tools necessary to discover advanced editing tricks on your own, but still contain some useful tips for professionals.Finally, the upcoming version of GIMP, and its progress will be discussed. If ready by the presentation, a new version will be demonstrated, and features will be explained. The overall progress of the new stable version will also be discussed, and some even newer features not released in the upcoming version will be demonstrated."},{"title":"The Shibboleth Project and Web Authentication at OSU","category":"","tags":"announcements,, shibboleth","url":"/announcements/2012/02/03/the-shibboleth-project-and-web-authentication-at-osu/","date":"02/03/2012","content":"This Thursday at 7:00PM, in Dreese Lab room 266, Scott Cantor will be presenting on OSU’s central web-based authentication system, Shibboleth. Many of Ohio State’s web-based applications and services rely on this open source project for authentication of students and employees and to obtain information about those users for personalization or limiting access to authorized users.Shibboleth is primarily based on an open standard called SAML that allows for authentication of users from multiple organizations to services running at different organizations, a security model called “federated identity”. The key benefit to users is the ability to leverage a password or other credentials shared with a trusted site (such as OSU’s login service) to access a variety of other sites without disclosing one’s password to them.Scott Cantor, the administrator of the OSU web login environment, and a developer on the Shibboleth project for about 10 years, will discuss the project, the SAML standard and federated identity in general, and their future directions.

It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures.  When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs."},{"title":"This Week in Slashdot","category":"","tags":"announcements,, slashdot","url":"/announcements/2011/10/30/this-week-in-slashdot/","date":"10/30/2011","content":"This Thursday, in Dreese Labs room 266, Alex Lingo will host his infamous This Week in Slashdot™ discussion.

From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article, by posting comments. These comments are then moderated by a randomly selected group of readers who can each add or subtract points from a limited number of comments for being funny/insightful/informative or offtopic/troll/flamebait, leaving only the highest rated comments immediately visible below the summary, often collectively making for a better read than the original article.

The senator who introduced the Espionage amendment (SHIELD Act, by John Ensign R-NV) which sparked this movement is also no longer in office, although a key co-sponsor Joe Lieberman I-CT is still in office. Therefore, during the election procedure I believe we should also vote on its removal.

This carefully considered decision was not made lightly, but we wish to honor some of our former members who now reside in Redmond, WA and set our political differences aside.After much deliberation, out of respect for many of our former members, we in the Open Source Club administration have decided to partner with Microsoft. Despite our general hostility, and Microsoft’s apparent attitude toward our philosophy, Microsoft has always been friendly to the club. We in the Open Source Club have at times been hostile towards the Microsoft club and their events, but have now come to realize what Visual Studio has to offer the community. As part of our partnership, all members are now encouraged to sign in with their Windows Live ID, using the link on the left. Additionally, our website search has been replaced with Bing Search. In return for this sponsorship, Microsoft will provide all Linux users willing to format their drives with a free copy of Windows 7 Home Basic (coming soon). Additionally, as part of our partnership, all registration information may be shared with Microsoft or its affiliates unless you opt out.APRIL FOOLS!!!We currently have no intention of partnering with Microsoft, and as far as we know the ntSig club remains inactive. This has been a well-meaning hoax by your webmaster.

I’ll be covering a brief outline on how wireless networks work, the several types of encryption available, and other settings that can set to try to protect your network. I’ll be demonstrating these attacks as well, and I’ll be needing help in this endeavor and I encourage people to bring their laptops if they wish to participate. I encourage people to follow along and learn the most they can about wireless security. I’m bringing my own equipment for us to attack and I’m giving permission to those who attend to help out and to help show off the weakness of various types or security implementations that I will be covering.

GIMP is what some might consider an open source alternative to the proprietary $800 Photoshop application, except that many people refuse to consider it on the grounds that it is allegedly inferior, and therefore unusable. While I’m not familiar with Photoshop, I will debunk the myth about GIMP being unusable, and show just how powerful GIMP can be for those who take the time to learn it. I’ll do this by teaching you how to perform arbitrary Photoshop-esque techniques in GIMP.For those who don’t remember, I did promise to cover the new Gimp 2.8, which was scheduled to be released December 27th, 2010[1]. However, Gimp 2.8 has not yet been released. I expect to have the beta version (2.7.1) as well as the stable version (2.6.10) in case things go wrong. The gimp 2.7 may be unstable, so I can make no promises, and I am aware of at least one feature anticipated in 2.8 that is not included in the 2.7.1 version I found.Image manipulation is done a by-case basis, so what works on one image may not work on another. Use of these editors is best learned by practice, as opposed to lectures, so the presentation will be interactive and based on audience feedback. Use of a laptop with GIMP already installed was recommended. Questions are also encouraged, so please come prepared with ideas of what you would like to see - as basic as “how do I save as a JPEG” to as advanced as “how do I remove braces?” or anything else you can think of. Asking your questions below in advance will help me to prepare relevant content for you.While I have some example content, basic to advanced, the talk will be focused on what you want to cover. This can be anything from a quick adjustment of the color/contrast/angle for your pictures, to completely removing a girlfriend/parent/sibling, to rendering lightning bolts, to making the picture just… lie. By the time you leave, you should qualify as a Fox News editor."},{"title":"OSU Sign-on and OpenID Now Supported","category":"","tags":"announcements,, shibboleth","url":"/announcements/2011/01/04/osu-sign-on-and-openid-now-supported/","date":"01/04/2011","content":"In response to feedback we received about having to log into our site (and resetting passwords each time), as well as insanely difficult CAPTCHAs, we have taken steps to make things a little easier for everyone. Effective immediately, an OSU name.n will now log any current student, faculty, or staff member into our website, as well as most alumni and former staff. To use it, simply click the link on the left-side of any page titled “OSU Sign-on” and enter your OSU username and password (same password you use for Carmen/grades/etc). Logging in this way will automatically mark your account as identified and give you the ability to post anything without moderator approval, as well as any other options previously unavailable to anonymous or unverified users.Additionally, we support OpenID. Unlike with your OSU login (which uses Shibboleth), an OpenID will not automatically flagg your account as identified if you register a new account with it. However, you may tie unlimited OpenIDs to your verified account. Using either OpenID or your OSU sign-on, you can now log into our website without ever having to enter a password in our site.The first time you log in or register on this website, you may need to follow these instructions for one of 3 methods. It is possible to use all or any combination of them to use our website, and you can tie all 3 methods to the same account. This page documents how to use each of the methods and the advantages and disadvantages of each, as well as what to do if you have never signed into our website before. You should wind up with the same privileges no matter which method you use. This page does not talk about club membership; we do not formally keep track of membership except as absolutely required by the Ohio State University to maintain formal status as a registered student organization. If you are still looking to be recognized as a member to any degree, we recommend you attend our weekly meetings, register on our mailing list, and register on this website (instructions below). NOTE: We recommend using the same e-mail address on the mailing list and this website (read more).OSU Sign-on:If you are an OSU student, faculty, or staff member, it is recommended that you sign into this website with your OSU internet username, at least the first time you use our website. Do not enter this information into our login form that appears on every page, but instead use the “OSU Sign-on” link - your OSU username and password are considered restricted information, and they are not stored on this website, but verified to us by another OSU service. This login is the same as what you log into for your e-mail, grades, Carmen, and a number of other services, and as long as you are affiliated with OSU in some fashion, you can continue to authenticate through the web authentication service. If you sign in this way, you will automatically inherit privileges of an approved account for the duration of your session, and within a day OpenID or Drupal sign-ins should include these privileges as well. These privileges may include but are not limited to viewing user profiles, posting content that isn’t sent to a moderation queue (as is the case for anonymous submissions), or voting on polls. You cannot use this option if you are not affiliated with OSU, but you can still gain full access to our website by the methods below.After your first time logging in, we recommend that you initiate a password reset by signing out and clicking on “Request new password” so you can set a separate password for your account. Although you can continue logging in with your OSU username and password as long as you’re affiliated, once you graduate OSU and your name.n stops working, will no longer be able to sign in with your name.n. Initiating a password reset “confirms” your account, for technical purposes I won’t explain here, and allows you to sign in without OSU’s single sign-on service (Shibboleth). Once you do this, you can (optionally) set your own password, or add an OpenID so you can sign in with a 3rd-party service.OpenID:You can tie an OpenID to your account from your user profile page and clicking on the tab labeled OpenID Identities. All accounts have permission to do this, and doing so (like with the OSU sign-on) allows you to sign in without entering a password into this website, so you don’t have to create a new password or worry about repeating the same password here as on another website. There is no limit on the number of OpenIDs you can tie to a single account, but we recommend you tie all OpenIDs to your existing verified account instead of creating multiple accounts.If you do not already have an account on this website, you can register with OpenID, but you will have the same limited privileges as if you register directly, and you won’t have the opportunity to pick your username. Of course, this means you’re entering a password into our website, but you could always just enter something random you’re never going to use (please use a strong password) then tie the OpenID to your account and use that. If you’re affiliated with OSU, you can also follow the instructions to enable OpenID for your OSU sign-on, and you’ll have full access from OpenID but you will be forced to use your name.n as the username (if you’re just logging in the first time it may take up to a day for the new privileges to migrate over to OpenID).If you do not have an OSU account, and are not affiliated with the Ohio State University, you are more than welcome to use this website fully, but you will have to have your account verified. This can be done in person with the club’s administration, or by immediately setting your e-mail address to something verifiable when you first sign in. If you do not set it right away on your first time logging in, chances are an administrator will overlook your account and you will need to fill out a support request. Examples of such e-mail addresses are SOME_USER@XXX.gov, STUDENT@SCHOOL.edu, or something with a clear name from a well-known organization (e.g. fsf.org) where creating multiple free e-mail addresses is out of the question. Examples of e-mail addresses that will not verify your account are crackmonkey79@gmail.com, anon007@mailinator.com, or viagra@provider.ru. Despite this, registration on our website is completely open. Anybody is welcome on our website, and these account limitations for unidentified users are exclusively meant as an anti-spam measure, not to restrict users.Drupal sign-in (local):In addition to the methods above, you may also register directly (local) on our website. The advantage to registering this way is that you get to pick your username, which would automatically be assigned if you use Shibboleth or OpenID. You do not need to be affiliated with the Ohio State University to use this method, but keep in mind that if you are affiliated with OSU then you will need to use your name.n username if you want your account to be compatible with your OSU account. A conflicting username can lock you out from your OSU login. Only an administrator can change your username, and this is the only way to correct the problems that will arise if you try to use your OSU login later on. If you’re not affiliated with OSU, or you have no intention of using the OSU login service, then this doesn’t apply to you. Also, do NOT register with the name.n of someone else — it’s not funny, it’s not cute, it won’t accomplish anything for you. We’ve already tested that, and if some wise-ass thinks otherwise, tries it, and the account doesn’t get flagged for abuse, then here’s what will happen: then the next time the owner of that squatted OSU username logs into our site through the OSU login service, they will take control of that account you just registered and automatically reset the password and e-mail address to their own — congratulations, your cleverness just got your OWN account p0wned and you effectively banned yourself from our website.As with OpenID, you must use a verifiable e-mail address to be granted full access to our website. Although you can immediately sign in, add OpenID accounts, and post with your selected username, you will not be granted full access automatically, and you will have to wait for an administrator to approve your account. This usually happens within less than 1 day, as administrators are automatically alerted about the account creation, but over holidays or breaks when the administrators are not around, it can potentially take longer. Because of this delay, OSU faculty, staff, and students are encouraged to follow the instructions above for using their OSU credentials to access this website; sessions created by the OSU login service are granted full privileges automatically."},{"title":"Chroot and Linux From Scatch","category":"","tags":"announcements,, linux,, chroot,, linux, from, scratch","url":"/announcements/2011/01/01/chroot-and-linux-from-scatch/","date":"01/01/2011","content":"Thursday, January 6th, 2011 at 7:00PM in Dreese 264 (note the change in location), Daniel Thau will be giving a dual presentation covering the chroot operation as well as the Linux From Scratch project.Chroot, available on all major Unix-y systems, changes the root directory from the point of a selected program and its children.  Effectively, this is somewhat akin to vitalization (with a number of comparative benefits and deficiencies relative to actual vitalization).  Some uses of chroot include the creation of a testing environment, a separated environment for compatibility reasons, limited privilege separation, and recovery of unbootable or otherwise hampered systems.  While chroot is available on other Unix-y systems, the presentation will focus on it’s uses with Linux distributions.The other topic, Linux From Scratch, is a collection of documentation which walks a user through the processes of creating a functional Linux distribution.  While the base LFS system is fairly minimal, LFS has sister projects (such as Beyond Linux From Scratch) which allow a LFS-based system to (after a lot of work) fit the needs of almost any type of Linux distribution, from an extremely minimal embedded system to a fully featured desktop or server.

GIMP is what some might consider an open source alternative to the proprietary $800 Photoshop application, except that many people refuse to consider it on the grounds that it is allegedly inferior, and therefore unusable. While I’m not familiar with Photoshop, I will debunk the myth about GIMP being unusable, and show just how powerful GIMP can be for those who take the time to learn it. I’ll do this by teaching you how to perform arbitrary Photoshop-esque techniques in GIMP.Image manipulation is done a by-case basis, so what works on one image may not work on another. Use of these editors is best learned by practice, as opposed to lectures, so the presentation will be interactive and based on audience feedback. Use of a laptop with GIMP already installed was recommended. Questions are also encouraged, so please come prepared with ideas of what you would like to see - as basic as “how do I save as a JPEG” to as advanced as “how do I remove braces?” or anything else you can think of. Asking your questions below in advance will help me to prepare relevant content for you.While I have some example content, basic to advanced, the talk will be focused on what you want to cover. This can be anything from a quick adjustment of the color/contrast/angle for your pictures, to completely removing a girlfriend/parent/sibling, to rendering lightning bolts, to making the picture just… lie.

Through a storytelling device, he will explain that Mutt is solely a mail user agent and requires other pieces and parts in order to function as a complete email solution. Once the entire system is complete, the user will have powerful regex capabilities, email threading, offline email access, pgp encryption and signing, sending and receiving from multiple addresses, 256 color inbox sorting, and synching with gmail if one wishes.

However, Uniprint only supports Mac and Windows; Linux users are out of luck and left with the options of either installing a new operating system to print their documents or using a lab computer (if available). Therefore, we in the Open Source Club have decided to publish a tutorial so fellow Linux users can print to their libraries from their laptops or dorm rooms just like Windows/Mac users can.First, we need to have CUPS installed. This is the default in many Linux distributions as far as I know. If it’s not installed by default, please leave a comment.With CUPS installed, go to http://localhost:631/ and click on “Add Printer”. Fill in your own description and pick a meaningful description location that you will remember later on (e.g. Science &amp;amp; Engineering Library, Color Printer). For the printer Name, you will want to look up your printer in the table below. Fill it in and click on “continue”.On the next page, select “LPD/LPR Host or Printer” for the device and click “continue”. Now, for Device URI, fill in the URI shown in the table below. For example, if I want to print to the printer in room 45 of Thompson Library, I would enter lpd://128.146.12.138/li0045-hp4200mobile. Now, select the printer’s manufacturer (should be in the model name) for Make. If the instructions for your printer below mention uploading a PPD file instead of saying the model, upload it here; otherwise, in the table that comes up select the closest match to the corresponding printer model (listed below). When your web browser prompts you for a username and password, enter the administrative username/password for the computer you’re on, or the username/password of some other user in the lpadmin group. You may be redirected to a page with a lot of optional configurations options. At this point all of your applications should be able to use that printer, and have it listed as one of your installed printers, but you may wish to customize your settings for it. Remember that you will still need to swipe your BuckID at the print station to pay for and release your print job.Note: The installers from Uniprint will install a Popup Client program, which asks for a username, password, and title. This is not (yet) possible for Linux. Instead, the username will be the username you’re logged into your computer with and the title will be whatever the title is of what you’re printing. There will be no password. This means that from the time you send your document to the printer queue, until the time you go and pick it up, anybody can swipe their ID to pick it up. Do not send confidential or sensitive information to the printer because it is not possible to password protect it, even though Uniprint’s proprietary program will add a password.PrinterNameURIModel265 EA BuildingEA265lpd://128.146.88.5/eamobileHP LaserJet 4200 Series275 EA BuildingEA275lpd://128.146.12.142/eamobile1HP LaserJet 4200 Series285 EA BuildingEA285lpd://128.146.12.142/eamobile1HP LaserJet 4200 Series295 EA BuildingEA295lpd://128.146.88.5/eamobileHP LaserJet 4200 SeriesAgriculture Admin SCCAg_Admin_Lablpd://128.146.12.142/agmobileHP LaserJet 4200 SeriesArchitectre Library (B&amp;amp;W)Arc_BWlpd://140.254.224.171/arcbwmobileHP LaserJet 4200 SeriesArchitectre Library (Color)Arc_Colorlpd://140.254.224.171/arccolormobileLANIER LD228cBaker Hall West[i](#residencehallrestricted)Baker_Hall_Westlpd://128.146.217.231/bakerwestspool1HP LaserJet 5000 SeriesBaker Systems 590BE590lpd://128.146.12.142/bemobileHP LaserJet 4200 SeriesCampbell Hall 119CM119lpd://128.146.12.142/cmmobileHP LaserJet 4200 SeriesDigital Union (B&amp;amp;W)DU_BWlpd://164.107.183.24/digitalunion_bwmobileHP LaserJet 4345 MFPDigital Union (Color)DU_Colorlpd://164.107.183.24/digitalunion_colormobile(Upload [xrx7655.ppd](/sites/default/files/stp-pcl-5.5.1.ppd)[iii](#untested) file)Drackett Tower Lobby[i](#residencehallrestricted)Drackett_Towerlpd://128.146.217.231/drackettspool1(Upload [stp-pcl-5.5.1.ppd](/sites/default/files/stp-pcl-5.5.1.ppd)[iii](#untested) file)517 Dreese Lab[ii](#labrestricted)DL517&quot;lpd://eceprint1.ece.ohio-state.edu/dl517mobile1HP LaserJet 4300 Series557 Dreese Lab[ii](#labrestricted)DL557lpd://eceprint1.ece.ohio-state.edu/dl557mobile1HP LaserJet 4300 Series817 Dreese Lab[ii](#labrestricted)DL817lpd://eceprint1.ece.ohio-state.edu/dl817mobile1HP LaserJet 4300 Series260 Caldwell Lab[ii](#labrestricted)CL260lpd://eceprint1.ece.ohio-state.edu/cl260mobile1HP LaserJet 4300 SeriesFAES LibraryFAES_Librarylpd://140.254.228.35/agadminmobileHP LaserJet 4200 SeriesFine Arts Libary (B&amp;amp;W)FineArts_BWlpd://140.254.224.198/finartbwmobileHP LaserJet 4200 SeriesFine Arts Library (Color)FineArts_Colorlpd://140.254.224.198/finartcolormobileHP color LaserJet 4600Geology Library (B&amp;amp;W)Geo_BWlpd://140.254.224.110/geomobileHP Color LaserJet 4700Geology Library (Color)Geo_Colorlpd://140.254.224.110/geomobilecolorHP Color LaserJet 4700171 Hagerty HallHG171lpd://164.107.189.195/hgmobileHP LaserJet 4200 SeriesBlack Cultural Center[ii](#labrestricted)BCClpd://140.254.46.41/bccmobile1HP LaserJet 4050 Series354 Hopkins Hall (Color)HC354_Colorlpd://164.107.190.133/HCcolormobileLANIER LP 036c354 Hopkins Hall (B&amp;amp;W)HC354_BWlpd://164.107.190.133/HCbwmobileHP LaserJet 4200 SeriesHowlett HallHT272lpd://128.146.12.142/htmobileHP LaserJet 4200 Series050 Jennings HallJE050lpd://128.146.12.142/jemobileHP LaserJet 4200 Series220 Journalism BldgJR220lpd://128.146.12.142/jrmobileHP LaserJet 4200 Series270 Journalism BldgJR270lpd://164.107.184.10/jr272mobileHP LaserJet 4200 SeriesLane Ave Residence Hall[i](#residencehallrestricted)Lane_Avenuelpd://128.146.217.231/lanespool1HP LaserJet 4000 SeriesLaw Library LaserJet 4200[i](#residencehallrestricted)LawHP4200lpd://140.254.18.235/LawHP4200HP LaserJet 4200 SeriesLaw Library LaserJet 8150[i](#residencehallrestricted)LawHP8150lpd://140.254.18.235/LawHP8150HP LaserJet 8150 SeriesMorrill Tower Lobby[i](#residencehallrestricted)Morrill_Towerlpd://128.146.217.231/morrillspool1HP LaserJet 4200 SeriesMorrison Tower Lobby[i](#residencehallrestricted)Morrison_Towerlpd://128.146.217.231/morrisonspool1HP LaserJet 4000 SeriesNorton House Lobby[i](#residencehallrestricted)Norton_Houselpd://128.146.217.231/nortonspool1HP LaserJet 4050 SeriesPaterson Hall Lobby[i](#residencehallrestricted)Paterson_Halllpd://128.146.217.231/patersonspool1HP LaserJet 4100 Series44 Pressey Hall Wireless Printer[i](#residencehallrestricted)SHSPHAROS-44lpd://128.146.89.20/shspharos-44mobileHP LaserJet 4250RPAC Welcome CenterRPAClpd://128.146.217.231/rpacspool1HP LaserJet 2430120 SEL Printers 1 &amp;amp;

We apologize for the short notice, and plan on inquiring into why our room was overbooked without our knowledge.Thursday, April 1st, at 7PM in Dreese Labs 266, Brian Swaney demonstrated how to effectively utilize the open source photo editing suite GIMP.Image manipulation is done a by-case basis, so what works on one image may not work on another. Use of these editors is best learned by practice, as opposed to lectures. The presentation was therefore interactive, and use of a laptop with GIMP already installed was encouraged. Questions were also encouraged, so please come prepared with ideas of what you would like to see - as basic as “what is a layer?” to as advanced as “how do I render lightning bolts?” or anything else you can think of. Comments are enabled, so you can post your ideas ahead of time.At the meeting, there was a lot of demand for a demonstration of rendering lightning bolts. Here is a copy of the example XCF image I generated. I followed this tutorial up to the point where they changed the colorization, then instead selected/cut out the bolt by color, applied the neon filter, and flattened the bolt. The image with Richard Stallman and Bill Gates was also popular, so you’ll find it here."},{"title":"Command Line Applications","category":"","tags":"announcements,, cli,, terminal","url":"/announcements/2010/01/25/command-line-applications/","date":"01/25/2010","content":"This Thursday, March 11th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 266, we will be holding a lightning talk session covering a multitude of command line applications.

Slashdot (commonly abbreviated as /.) is a website located at http://slashdot.org that deals in news for the nerdy. Readers submit articles which are then accepted or rejected by editors and then published on the site. From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article which can be very funny/interesting/insightful/etc and oft prove to be a very good read. Historically, the site has a history of having a pro open source bias, which is why we like it. Alex would like to take this format and apply it to a club meeting so that we can have similar discussions amongst our members in real time. No prior knowledge of /., or goings on in the world, is necessary to participate. Read slashdot prior to the meeting if you wish and bring your thoughts, opinions, ideas, rants, raves and what have you. I hope to see you all there, we love a good discussion!"},{"title":"Wireless hacking","category":"","tags":"announcements,, wifi,, wireless,, security,, privacy","url":"/announcements/2009/12/18/wireless-hacking/","date":"12/18/2009","content":"This Thursday, January 7th, at 7PM in Dreese Labs room 266, we are doing a talk and demonstration on hacking wireless networks. There will be 3 parts to the discussion. First, Brian Swaney will be talking about the dangers of poor security. He will go over why wireless communication is inherently insecure, what types of attacks are possible on wireless networks, some techniques common people use to try and secure their networks, and why they ultimately fail. Alek Rollyson will then continue on and talk about the behind the scenes technicalities of the attacks that we will be presenting. He will go over some specific weaknesses in protocols used by wireless routers, how they might be exploited, and how to protect oneself. Finally, Michael Yanovich will show us how to use the aircrack-ng suite to actually perform the attacks. He will show how to exploit all the common mistakes users make in securing their network, all using the free, open source aircrack suite. We look forward to seeing you all there.

I began using an 026 keypunch machine in my student days (which clearly did not need an editor). My first interactive time-sharing experience was using CITRAN (which was commonly known as SHITRAN). My first pleasant time-sharing experience was using TECO (TExt COrrector) and SOS (Son Of Stopgap) on Digital Equipment Corporation computers using a 110 baud interactive teletype machine. (The joke was that it was very difficult to differentiate TECO commands from line noise - since phone lines were very noisy in the old days.) Emacs (Editor MACroS) began as a set of macros for TECO and then grew to be the hydralike creature it is today. I will show you the commands I commonly use in writing programs (I will even hand out my cheat sheet for these commands on a sheet of paper!) and hopefully discuss the commands you would like to use.

The catch is, it sucks, and your instructors can hold your grade in the balance if you don’t play with their new toy1. The program is inappropriately called “Respondus LockDown Browser,” and it’s supposed to be the next generation of “secure” test taking. While I passionately despise those who earn their marks unduly by plagiarism/forgery/exam-shoulder-surfing, this program is invasive and outright stupid. Take a look at the demo.This is exactly what media vendors like to call Trusted Computing, and what the GNU foundation describes as Treacherous Computing. Trusted/Treacherous Computing (depending on who you ask), by design, controls what a user can and cannot do with their computer. It is meant such that your computer will obey the company who wrote the software instead of you. I don’t have a problem with regulating what students can and cannot do when they take exams, but we should not be expected to use this junkware, especially not without some alternate means of taking the exam. It’s either take the test in a noisy computer lab, or install the program on your own computer. I can’t vouch for anyone else, but personally I certainly don’t like those options, and would much rather take my exam in person.First of all, this is the first time anyone at this school has been able to require the use of a specific piece of software to earn a marginal grade. Unless instructors specifically state on the syllabus that you must use a specific proprietary program, such as Microsoft Office for some earlier CSE courses, they cannot hold it against you for submitting a final paper in PDF format instead of Microsoft Word. They may recommend we conform to the Microsoft way and use the standard XP/Vista with Microsoft Office, but they do not require it. Believe it or not, unless an instructor specifically stated on the syllabus that a student must be using a specific version of a specific program, the instructor cannot hold a student accountable for not submitting an assignment in the latest and greatest Microsoft Office format, so long as it is a generally readable format, such as PDF. Statistics classes sometimes use SPSS, but the students are not required to use it. In Math 152, students can compute calculus equations with spreadsheets, but OpenOffice.org is acceptable. While you may not get the same support for it from OIT, you can still connect to OSU’s network with a Linux operating system (just not an out-of-date operating system, as per MCSS). They don’t even specifically require you to use their corporate anti-virus, which you can get for free here. Now, they are requiring a specific program, upon which you are graded, and the program needs to be run in a proprietary operating system. You need not look any further than the Ubuntu forums to find users complaining being discriminated against for their operating system. I suppose a more appropriate name for this new toy is “Respondus™ Lock-Out Browser” - I’m willing to negotiate rights to the trade mark if Respondus is interested; it may earn some perks from Microsoft…Violating their norm of freedom to use whatever software you choose, and of making their web pages W3C-compliant isn’t the only concern this program raises though. One must ask, as I did when I first saw the above video, what if the browser, web page, or something in between malfunctions? At the time, I had taken very few Carmen quizzes, and didn’t have access to any, much less requiring me to play with OSU’s new anti-cheating toy, so I couldn’t really join in on their fun, but that didn’t stop me from closely and thouroughly investigating the matter. I found a number of ways in which a student could bypass its restrictions, some of which I’ll cover later on, and used some of them to simulate just what would happen in such an event. The program restricts use of Windows’ Task Manager, most commonly known as “Control-Alt-Delete”. Since I normally use Linux as my primary operating system, and use Windows for something to feed virus samples to anti-viruses so I could test their definitions, I had a few tools to force processes to quit, and make a few other deep cuts to the operating system. To perform this, I launched AVG Anti-Spyware between the time I launched Respondus Lockdown Browser, and the time it fully started up. As the browser filled up my screen, removed the Taskbar (Start Menu and System Tray), and planted its other generally invasive hooks, AVG opened on top of the browser. I then used AVG’s process monitor to terminate “LockDown.exe”, and found its hooks remained in effect, despite the program having closed. The Taskbar was still removed, right-clicking had no effect, pressing [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[Delete] or [Alt]+[F4] opened an error message that the said operation was disabled by my administrator (which was funny because I am the administrator for my laptop, and I should be allowed to properly shut down Windows if I want). After restarting Windows, the right-clicking worked again, and I saw the Start Menu again, but I was still unable to shut down Windows or open the Task Manager. Seriously. The option to shut down Windows was removed from the Start Menu. Essentially, I was permanently forbidden from ever using the single most common part of Windows, pressing Control-Alt-Delete, as well as from shutting down Windows. I noticed this also happens if the computer is unexpectedly shut down while the program is running, which to do so you need to remove the battery and unplug it. This, along with the fact that during a quiz you are forbidden from closing the browser during a quiz, makes you completely dependent on everything to work properly, with your operating system’s stability hanging in the balance. As most programmers will know, no program is perfect, and there will be at least some problems, so this program will make damaging changes to people’s computers, who don’t have a choice about using it because their grades are dependent on their compliance. I encountered one such error, and while I was fortunately not required to use this program to take the quiz at that time, it does raise concerns. I took a screenshot here; pardon the strange interface for those who are not familiar with Linux. You’ll notice an “Internal server error” in the bottom-left corner. Upon encountering this, I was unable to save any more responses or submit the quiz. I actually had to e-mail the screenshot to the TAs managing the quiz and have them grade the e-mail instead. Now, what if I were required to use Respondus Lockdown Browser to take the quiz? I would have been “locked in” a dead web page, prevented (supposedly) from using any other programs or closing this program, and left with only the option of improperly shutting down Windows, which as mentioned before, will result in problems. Basically, to get my computer back, I’d have to bite the bullet and let the restrictions on my computer become permanent. I would personally like a response from OIT on this matter. The first time I discovered this, I asked them to fix it; their program, they clean up the mess, right? Plus, I didn’t expect that to happen and didn’t have the time to re-install. They were able to help me find an article to restore the task manager, but not to shut down Windows. I was able to restore this with one of my security applications, SpyBot S&amp;amp;D, but that was only because I was lucky enough to have had it installed earlier and it detected a certain system change. I sent 8-Help an e-mail regarding the matter, so they could assist other users who encounter the same problem by creating a guide on their site, but I instead received a response from a Carmen administrator telling me to send my concerns to Respondus themselves, who are clearly not going to do anything about it, instead of escalating my ticket. I also sent them this video in my message, in response to their claim that they did not believe the problems I was facing were due to their kiosk browser, but I wasn’t intent on reaching the Carmen admin at that point.Ok, so Ohio State is going through a lot to stop cheating, which doesn’t surprise me, and they should in general, because cheaters suck. However, this program is not only unsafe, but ineffective. Before I start describing how to circumvent its restrictions, let me point out the easiest way of completely bypassing it, which this program can never stop. All one has to do is use another computer. It can be a lab computer, they can use a desktop/laptop combination, or borrow one from a friend or roommate, and take turns cheating. Instructors who hesitate to give tests online sometimes fear for students’ ability to cheat if they aren’t monitored, but when they hear of this new program that is supposed to solve the age-old problem while they can relax and focus on their research, letting Carmen do the grading, they feel relieved and reassured. This program is not going to stop students from taking pictures of the test with their cell phones, it’s not going to stop students from taking group tests or paying another person to take it for them, it’s not going to stop students from looking at notes or textbook material, it’s not going to stop students from accessing online resources to find answers elseware, and it’s not going to stop students from copying answers from elseware. You are not going to stop cheating by telling students to take the quiz in their dorms, unsupervised, on their personal computers, no matter what kind of junk you force them to install. Ohio State clearly did not research this in advance. The numberof high-profile universities, which are supposed to consist of members who are intelligent enough (no offense) to know better, that got suckered into this scam, and still trust the program to solve the cheating problem, proves to me, without a doubt in my mind, the inconceivable power of advertising. On a more serious note, if an instructor wants to be certain that there is no cheating, they have to do it the old-fashioned, proven effective way, and actually watch for cheaters. If someone from TELR is reading this, please heed my words and reasearch products before buying them, especially the ones from unsatiisfied users. Now onto how easily it is circumvented from within the affected machine.In a previous version of this article I covered advanced ways of bypassing the restrictions, which confused some users, but I’m just going to touch on some of the more basic ones. If you want the original version, click here. Upon startup, Respondus Lockdown Browser checks your running processes against a list of “known cheating programs”, such as “aim.exe”. Opening the main executable in notepad will predictably display a bunch of garbage, but you can find a list of blacklisted programs in plain text. A funny note, after I posted my video on Windows getting hosed by Respondus Lockdown Browser, they updated it to prevent use of AVG. I guess Respondus doesn’t like me exposing how crappy their program is on public websites, because I can’t think of any other good reason they would require users to terminate background processes that help to protect their computer. Anyway, the funny thing about this algorithm is how easy it is to bypass. All a user has to do is take the blacklisted file, such as “aim.exe”, and rename it to something not on the list, such as “xyz.exe”, double-click it, and Respondus will ignore it. Note: while their updates are a little unorganized, a current version will also check a few other variables which are harder to change. Of course, you could always just use the old version, not to advocate cheating. I have found several other holes, such as running arbitrary programs during a session, opening links in other browers, or moving the window around to access your desktop, and 2 particularly “critical” forms of them remain unpublished, as a reminder to Respondus that there are still easy ways to bypass their restrictions. An additional hole, which is just in the design, is the philosophy that blacklist, or signature-based definitions of malicious are going to have many false negatives. This is a concept discussed in CSE 551, in which I am currently enrolled, and that is common knowledge among anti-virus vendors who are researching heuristics analysis. For example, I found a really nice open source screenshot program, which is not well-published, that automatically takes screenshots in a user-specified interval, and was able to do wonders as far as photographing tests is concerned because it didn’t recognize the program. There may be infinitely many programs like this, and Respondus is never going to block them all because someone will just come along and write another.Speaking of writing programs, I really hope they don’t excpect computer science majors (including myself) to use Respondus Lockdown Browser. The use of this proprietary program raises a concern about requiring use of certain operating systems, despite the policy of not requiring use of specific software. Since it only runs in Windows XP (when I last tested it in Vista, it was extremely unstable), and Mac OSX. You will have many users using Linux, and other less common operating systems that this program can’t run on. You will have students running Windows XP inside of other operating systems (picture), with full access to online resources; you will have student locked out for the operating system they use (those who don’t run virtual machines); you will have students discovering all sorts of ways around it; you will have students spoofing Lockdown Browser sessions on Carmen; you will have students modifying the code; and such students will be particularly unhappy when they are told they have to use a certain proprietary operating system.The recommended installation procedure for Respondus Lockdown Browser requires that ActiveX be enabled as you follow a link to their download site, which isn’t even in OSU’s domain. ActiveX, which is Microsoft’s Windows-only way of letting websites run arbitrary C++ code on your machine, is an extremely unsafe-natured script. I’ve seen Windows get bit in the rear by it, and helped users clean it off their machine many times. When a user asks me about sites asking to run ActiveX, I tell them to “just say no”. Now, surely OSU must understand the nature of this script, do they not? If they are as dead-set on securing the network as they claim to be, then why on Earth are they telling users to run ActiveX? Here is a website, though out-of-date, that accurately describes how ActiveX has made Outlook an extremely unsafe program. If anyone doesn’t believe me, here is where you install the silly program. If ActiveX isn’t enough of a bite, they even use Java applets to install it on Macs. Take a look. I guess for some reason Respondus must have been too good to simply link to a .dmg, .exe, or .msi file in a simple HTML tag. That’s what they think of W3C standards I guess.All of this summed up, Respondus Lockdown Browser is not an effective way to stop cheating. It is frustrating for students who are genuinely interested in the material and have to put up with a lousy program to gain access to the material, and completely ineffective at its intended purpose. This sort of makes me think of copy-protection, a.k.a. DRM. Look where DRM is going. Content producers have tried many times to regulate what users can do, and you wind up with the true, hardcore pirates cracking it, and the legitimate users resorting to P2P just so they can avoid all the invasive restrictions. They make worse and worse DRM controls, run around rampant suing single mothers with children living off SSI for sums that will drop your jaw, and drive more and more people away. The true cheaters are always going to find a way to cheat, while the honest students are the ones who suffer for it by using this piece of crap; just like how the true pirates will always crack the copy protection and the legitimate customers are the ones who suffer from not being able to play songs in “unauthorized” media players, or move them to other media devices. If it doesn’t work for the multi-billion-dollar companies, then why the Hell does OSU expect it to work for them? It didn’t work well for the University of Dayton…2What can we do? OSU already bought a campus-wide license for us to use it, and they’re going to make sure to get the most use out of it right? If something gets an overall negative reaction in a university, unless it makes a significant profit for the institution, they won’t keep it around for long. Let the coordinators of this project know how you feel about it by e-mailing carmen@osu.edu. If you get spam filtered, as I did, send it using their form here. Let them know (politely) that the browser isn’t going to do it’s job (NOTE: I do not recommend spamming or harassing them). Tell your instructors what they are really asking when they restrict you to using this browser. If you are an instructor who agrees with this article, then please don’t place this burden on your students. Ask yourself first, “Would you want your grade based on the type software that you use?” Would you be willing to use this piece of junk? If not, then please make this point to the directors that told you to use it. If you don’t say anything, then they will continue as normal under the assumption that everyone is fine with it and their new program is working wonderfully. To the students reading this, Let your instructors know we shouldn’t be required to use a specific program to get a marginal grade, when the software otherwise has nothing to do with the content. Let them know that this regulatory software puts a burden on the honest students who are legitimately interested in learning the material, while it has little to no impact on the cheaters, because they will just find one of many ways around the “controlled environment” anyway. If you sit there Mahatma Gandhi once said “you must be the change you wish to see in this world.” If we don’t let OSU know what we think about being “locked down” from our own computers, they will not stop, and probably eventually try something worse. Who knows? Maybe they’ll try having you take a test with one hand on a fingerprint scanner the whole time and fail you automatically if you ever take it off or if it gets unplugged. Let’s encourage OSU to find better things to spend our tuition on than bad software, before they wind up as confident in it as The University of Florida or the many other schools making students use it3.I received a response from carmen@osu.edu, who thought my concerns were “unique”.

See a summary of what I’m presenting below.Key Points:  Net Neutrality is a principle, that if passed into law would prevent internet service providers from using their control over your internet connection for anything other than serving you.          It prevents ISPs from blocking/degrading access to competitors’ (or any) websites for commercial or political reasons.      It prevents ISPs from blocking/degrading/prioritizing services, such as video streaming, VoIP, music downloads, etc.        Net Neutrality is not about restricting free-trade.          Restrictions imposed on all companies will not create an “unfair advantage” for anyone.      Restricting or degrading access to smaller-scale sites for political or commercial reasons does create an “unfair advantage”.      Corporations will not regulate themselves. If their only incentive is money, and dis-servicing a few customers would make them an extra 10%, there is nothing but the law to stop them from it.      The ISPs own the equipment, but they did not “invent” the internet, nor was the internet created with this in mind.      Perhaps the most important reason, it is the very first amendment in our Bill of Rights. No media vendor has any place restricting people’s free speech, in the U.S. or anywhere.                  There is no reason for ISPs to start charging website owners - who aren’t even on their network - just so their users are able to access said websites. That’s not a “special service” – it’s extortion for money.                      ISPs claim that they can “improve quality” of services and websites by “prioritizing bandwidth” and cite the “congestion” as a dire need of action, and a sign of the “death of the internet”.  Restricting access to smaller websites, which is against net neutrality, would be the “death of the internet”. Nobody would visit said websites, owners wouldn’t generate enough revenue to continue hosting, and nearly all of the websites currently online would disappear forever by the end of the year.  The ability to charge incremental subscription rates for “premium bandwidth” would remove the providers’ incentive to fix the problem. They’d instead charge premium providers more and more to degrade other subscribers’ service, just so they can keep said premium providers’ bandwidth at a constant rate.Links:  What is Net Neutrality?

Find a summarized guide for those who aren’t having trouble with their closed-source drivers below.First, you should have the Gnome Network Manager installed. Most Ubuntu distributions come with this by default, and if it’s installed, you will see a wifi icon in the top-right corner of the screen near the date/time. If not, then (from a place where you do have internet access) run:sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnomeNow that the Network Manager is taken care of, you’ll need to ensure you have your OSU internet username handy. If you haven’t already, set up your account at here (this only applies if you are an incoming freshman/transfer student who does not have a name.# yet). If you forget your password, rather than re-registering, you can recover it at my.osu.edu. In the past, your wireless username and password were different from your OSU username and password. This has changed, and once you are enrolled in the Identify Management System the username and password will be the same. If you have a name.#, it may work for a short time but will not work forever.Now we’re ready to configure your device. Find a place on campus with wireless internet and click the Network Manager button. Select “osuwireless” from the list. Do not select osuguest or OSUVOICE, as these are off-limits to students. You’ll get a prompt that looks something like this. Make sure all of these fields match up, and fill in your OSU username and password (if you haven’t already signed up at my.osu.edu, this will not yet work for you).Now fill in your username and password, leaving the rest of the fields blank. (In this case, replace name.# with your OSU username.number.) If your prompt has a field listed as PEAP Version select “Version 0”. Anything else should be as shown above or left blank (default).If you are asked for a CA certificate file, you may (optionally) want to download and use one. Essentially, it’s supposed to help protect you from a man-in-the-middle attack, so if you don’t download it you might get a security warning when you first connect. To do this, you can select the right certificate authority in the prompt by browsing to /etc/ssl/certs/ and selecting AddTrust_External_Root.pem. This certificate is included by default in Ubuntu, and after selection network manager should not give you warnings again. If you get another warning about certificate errors after doing this… well, personally I would call shenanigans on the network if I saw that, since it probably means somebody is doing evil stuff to my connection.Once the fields are filled in as described, hit connect. If you’re within an acceptable range of the wireless access point, you should be able to load your favorite web page within 30 seconds. After you have connected the first time, your computer should automatically connect to osuwireless whenever it’s in range. If you attempted to connect to osuguest, Ubuntu will automatically try to connect to that network, possibly before trying osuwireless, and it won’t get anywhere. You can disable it by removing the “osuguest” folder in ~/.gconf/system/networking/wireless/networks/ and it will forget it ever tried to connect to osuguest."},{"title":"Website problems","category":"","tags":"announcements","url":"/announcements/2008/06/07/website-problems/","date":"06/07/2008","content":"We are currently having some problems with our content managing system, Drupal,so changes here will be limited.

We have a couple of important events occurring within the first few weeks of the quarter I’d like to talk a bit about, since they are new and exciting.The Opensource Club will be taking part in the Student Involvement Fair on September 18th. We will have a table in the Technology section of the fair. The Student Involvement Fair will be held from 12:00 noon to 4:00pm on the Oval and will include dozens of student organizations and thousands of attendees. This is a great chance to advertise ourselves to the incoming freshmen class and to all students of Ohio State.Then on September 30th is Ohio LinuxFest 2006! LinuxFest will be held at the Greater Columbus Convention Center in downtown Columbus. We are also proudly taking part in this event, with a table of our own. There will speakers, vendor and community exhibits, and plenty of swag. Information can be found on the Ohio LinuxFest website, and more will be added to the site soon. This is a chance to show the greater community our spirit and resolve to be a great community player.Both events are completely free to attend, but it should be noted that Ohio LinuxFest requires all attendees to register by September 22. LinuxFest is offering an All Conference Pass for $65.00, which is completely optional, and includes several perks, all detailed on the attendance page. We will be organizing a group of attendees once the date draws closer. I will send out more detailed e-mails about each event as they draw nearer.Now, we are currently in the planning stages, but one thing we would like to give away at both events is a flier detailing ourselves and listing at least our first five or six meetings of the quarter. For this, we need speakers. I’d like to ask for five speakers to offer to give presentations for the first few meetings of the quarter. We want to show anyone interested in our organization that we are alive, kicking, and in full-swing for the up-and-coming year. This year we will be continuing in the alternating Tuesday/Thursday at 7:00pm format that we used last year, since it seemed to work well for most people. If it turns out to not be the best way to continue, we can discuss alternate ideas.Barring any problems, here is my tentative schedule of meeting dates:  Monday 9/18: Student Involvement Fair  Thursday 9/21: Welcome Back with Alex!  Tuesday 9/26: Speaker needed  Saturday 9/30: Ohio LinuxFest 2006  Thursday 10/5: Speaker needed  Tuesday 10/10: Speaker needed  Thursday 10/19: Speaker needed  Tuesday 10/24: Speaker neededIf anyone is interested in speaking during those dates, feel free to contact me at lingo.13@osu.edu or by replying to this topic. I am looking forward to seeing the Opensource Club as strong as ever in the coming months, and these two events are a good way to start upon that road."},{"title":"Welcome Back with Alex! / Ideas for Ohio LinuxFest","category":"","tags":"announcements,, ohio, linuxfest","url":"/announcements/2006/09/21/welcome-back-with-alex-ideas-for-ohio-linuxfest/","date":"09/21/2006","content":"Date: 09/21/2006Time: 7:00PMRoom: 480 Dreese LabsWelcome back for the 2006-2007 school year! Come and find out what we are planning for this year for the Opensource Club and share your thoughts and ideas. Would you like to see less talk and more rock? Then come and voice your opinion! We are especially interesting in your ideas for the upcoming Ohio LinuxFest 2006. Linuxfest is a free conference of over a dozen open-source sponsors and twenty speakers, all celebrating the greatness that in Linux and open source. This year, The Opensource Club will have its very own booth set up for the conference. We need to come up with ideas on how we can use this awesome opportunity to reach out to the greater Linux and open source community. Months ago I made the decision to use Microwiki as the base of our website, replacing the old HTML site that we had previously. At around the same time, Freegeek Columbus switched from MediaWiki - the software that drives Wikipedia - to Mircowiki, and they seemed happy enough. It seemed a good choice for us. I thought that we should use something small and simple. Microwiki, weighing in at just 163 kilobytes, is undoubtably small and simple. However, as time wore on, it became clear that MicroWiki was not the best tool for the job. I pressed on, thinking that I could make it work. I never did. Here is a quick list of various problems I ran into:  There were woefully few options, which at first I had thought a good idea, but it became obvious that this was a problem.  There was no form of user management - unless you could phpMyAdmin.  Current users could register new users. Eventually this broke, and new users had to be added through database tricks and magic.  File/image upload never actually worked.  External links and images could not be embeded with standard HTML. Wiki syntax had to be used.  It was hard to theme. Different parts of the site were in different places, the CSS was hidden away in the database.A few days ago I made the decision to kick Microwiki to the curb, and I haven’t looked back since. Here’s a short and sweet list of some new features this Drupal-based website can offer:  User management, including profiles, user roles, and access controls.  Simpler editing tools. HTML!  File uploads now work, and users can attach files to their stories and pages.  Polls! What do you think about tax cuts for the upper tax bracket? Now we can find out!  Extensibility, through hundreds of modules.  Comments, with simple and powerful moderation.  Easy theming. I made this theme by modifying the default Drupal theme with just CSS, in a file!That was just off the top of my head, and I think I will find many modules that will add great new features as time goes on. Enjoy the new site. It is not complete, I am about 95% of the way there. The last 5% is just tightening things up and changing some things here and there. Soon I will be posting information about Ohio LinuxFest and our participation, so be on the lookout for that soon. Feel free and register, and don’t hesitate to leave comments on what you think. – Alex"},{"title":"Ohio LinuxFest 2006","category":"","tags":"announcements,, ohio, linuxfest","url":"/announcements/2006/09/21/ohio-linuxfest-2006/","date":"09/21/2006","content":"On September 30, 2006 Ohio LinuxFest 2006 will occur at the Greater Columbus Convention Center.

I’ve started work on it, and would appriciate any idea or comments you may have on it. You can download it at the bottom of the page in OpenDocument and PDF formats. Edit: The automatic uploader is not working, due to possible SELinux issues. I’ve linked to the files manually, and will look into the issue. Release notes:  It is in greyscale, as color printed through SOURCE is more expensive.  It is 3 2/3” x 8”, so three can be printed on a single sheet of 8” x 11” paper.      Peter hasn&#39;t confirmed with me that he will give his talk on 10/19.    Jim hasn’t decided on the topic of his talk, so I have put “Kitten Huffing” as a placeholder until he does.      I&#39;m going to rewrite the &quot;Welcome Back!&quot; text.    Part of the open source description and the net neutrality description are taken from Wikipedia. I plan on rewriting the net neutrality copy, but like the open source description. If we use it, we will have to place a GNU Free Documentation License boilerplate at the bottom.  The pamphlet will be updated for Ohio LinuxFest to remove references to previous meetings and to include information on more upcoming meetings.  I’ve added a condensed form of Peter’s talk description.  I’ve changed the size of the OSUOSS logo.For those who do not want to download the files, here is the complete text of the pamphlet:A student and community organization dedicated to the idea of open source software.
