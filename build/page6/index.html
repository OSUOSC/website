      <p>Greetings!</p>

<p>This Thursday, January 23rd 2014 at 7:00PM in Caldwell Labs <b>133</b> (note the change), Daniel Thau will be giving a presentation on Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS). DVCSs are distributed systems which keep track of software revisions. These are usually, but not necessarily, used to manage programming projects. Daniel will go over the idea behind a DVCS, as well as some of the stuff going on under the hood in one of them (git).</p>

<p>Laptops are encouraged, but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.</p>

<p>This Thursday, January 16th at 7pm in Caldwell Labs 120, Chris Wallace will present “Virtual Servers: An introduction to virtualization in linux”.</p>

<p>I’ll try to cover some of the common virtual server options in linux such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>KVM</li>
  <li>Xen</li>
  <li>OpenVZ</li>
  <li>Virtualbox</li>
</ul>

<p>and other solutions, as well as practical situations and reasoning for using a virtual server over a physical server.</p>

      <p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>I hope everyones break (as well as additional days off) have been swell. To celebrate, this Thursday, January 9 at 7pm in Caldwell Labs 120 we will be having an open-ended meeting with open discussion. To make things cooler, we will have nice pizza (adriadicos) and a raspberry pi and arduino to play around on.</p>

<p>This meeting will also be where we plan future meetings for the semester, so come with any ideas you may have!</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing you all back.</p>

  </li>
  <li>digraphs</li>
</ul>

<p>also, last week there was a big misunderstanding. I want to make sure that everyone knows the following about our meetings:</p>

<p>They are Discussions.
What does that mean?</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can speak up at any time for clarification, correction, or otherwise</li>
  <li>If something pans out where the conversation doesn’t seem to be going anywhere, it should be discussed later. (I definitely overreacted when this happened at our last meeting, and I apologize to all)</li>
</ul>

<p>Let me know if anyone has any questions or clarifications on this. We are a bunch of hackers on equal footing, new members and old. Meetings should reflect this :)</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

      <p>This Thursday, 2013/09/19 at 7pm, in Caldwell Labs 120, Chris Wallace will present Wireless Security. In this talk, we will discuss different ways of penetrating wireless access points with the goal of explaining how security works in a wifi world. The takeaway from this is that, once you’re out there, you should be able to protect your wifi as best as possible. This talk is intended to be interactive, which means that there will be an access point on location that we’ll be attempting to gain access to. This talk is also intended to be informative, which means that we’ll be discussing some of the different types of authentication out there in the world.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: We do not encourage the use of any of the software and/or techniques to be used on any equipment besides equipment that you either own or are given explicit permission from the owner of said equipment. Also we are NOT responsible for the actions people take using these techniques learned at this meeting. All information that is being taught is very easily available on the Internet via your favorite search engine. <strong>I reiterate, DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, DO THIS ON ANY EQUIPMENT YOU DO NOT OWN OR DO NOT HAVE EXPRESS WRITTEN PERMISSION TO DO SO.</strong> In order to get the most from this talk, it helps to come with the software preinstalled. There are only two packages they you need: aircrack-ng and “john the ripper.”</p>

<p>Aircrack-ng is available in almost any linux distribution repository. I know it’s available in Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora’s repositories. However, for “john the ripper” you’ll need to download and compile it for your laptop. You can find it here: http://www.openwall.com/john/g/john-1.7.6.tar.gz For more information about John The Ripper: http://www.openwall.com/john/</p>

<p>For more information about aircrack-ng: http://www.aircrack-ng.org/</p>

<p>If you want walk through what I’ll be covering, please come prepared (if possible, with the software installed and ready to go). If you have any trouble respond to the email or catch us on IRC (#osuosc on freenode) and we’ll help you out.</p>

<p>Every meeting, we mention something about our IRC channel. Some of you may not know what that means, so I wanted to clear everything up, as well as explain how to get chatting with us.</p>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>

<p>IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat, which is a protocol for communication primarily for group discussion. It is a client-server model, meaning that clients connect to a server and that server tells the client what the other clients are saying. The protocol is also fairly old, originating from 1988.</p>

<h4 id="getting-started-with-weechat">Getting Started with WeeChat</h4>

<p>WeeChat is an extendable IRC client for GNU/Linux. It utilizes a terminal to render its interface, but is crisp and clean with how it presents information. To install, first get WeeChat from your distribution’s package manager. After installation, start weechat from the command line with</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">$ weechat-curses</code></p>

<p>and watch it fire up!</p>

<p>To get connected to freenode, type the following into weechat</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">/connect irc.freenode.net</code></p>

<p>You may need to set your name as other users see it, which can be done with</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">/nick yourDesiredNick</code></p>

<p>After you are fully connected to freenode, join any room you like with</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">/join #osuosc</code></p>

<h4 id="running-weechat-with-screen">Running WeeChat with screen</h4>

<p>To <strong>idle</strong> with WeeChat, that is, keep your chat session open without ever leaving, one utility that can be used is screen. To start, run:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">$ screen weechat-curses</code></p>

<p>To detatch from this session, press control+a, then d. To reattach to this session, type</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">$ screen -r</code></p>

<p>Feel free to explore around freenode, and other IRC networks, as there are lots of interesting channels with different topics and projects behind them. I hope this has helped you!</p>

      <p>Thursday 2013/08/29 at 7pm in Dreese Lab 266, Chris Wallace and the Open Source Club will present “Linux InstallFest and Introduction”. This meeting will consist of two different hour-long blocks. In the first section, we will provide installation media for different distributions of the GNU/Linux operating system, with seasoned members present to help get those interested installed. In the second hour, we will provide an introduction to the GNU/Linux command line environment.</p>

<p>Overall, we would like you to not only have GNU/Linux installed, but also have a pretty good idea of the things you can do with it.</p>

<p>Laptops are always encouraged, though not required, and as always, there will be pizza.</p>
