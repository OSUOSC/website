title: Git - An Introduction and Explanation
meeting: November 12th 2015
---

Come join us Thursday, the 12th of November, as Nikit "Nefari0uss" Malkan talks about Git source control and how to use it for your projects (and perhaps even an upcoming hackathon).

I will talk about the different models of work flow, how source control plays a role, and then will talk extensively about *how* Git works. Following that, I will briefly cover how to use some basic Git commands and how to set it up quickly for the upcoming OHI/O 2015 hackathon. Plan on this meeting being slightly longer than usual as I want to ensure people will walk with a working knowledge of Git for the hackathon. Laptops are highly encouraged so you can follow along. A Github account is highly prefered as we will work on a live demo, time pertaining. As always there will be Pizza.
