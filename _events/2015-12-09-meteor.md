This Thursday, December 10th at 7PM in Caldwell 120, I will be discussing / demoing Meteor.js.

"Meteor is a full-stack JavaScript App Platform that assemble all the pieces you need to build modern web and mobile apps, with a single JavaScript codebase."

Laptops are encouraged but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.

Good luck on exams.
