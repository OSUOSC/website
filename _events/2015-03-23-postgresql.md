This Thursday, 2015-03-26 at 7:00pm in Caldwell Labs 120, Jeff Casavant will be speaking about PostgreSQL. A short description follows:

I'll be talking about the free and open-source relational database system PostgreSQL.  At gearDigital, the company I work for, we use it for our entire data infrastructure.  It closely adheres to the SQL standard, and is highly extensible, which gives it some interesting (and unique) capabilities.  I'll detail some of the more interesting things you can do with Postgres during my talk - including using it as a search engine, as a GIS database, and as a social media client.  I'll also cover some of the more advanced traditional features.

Laptops are encouraged but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.
