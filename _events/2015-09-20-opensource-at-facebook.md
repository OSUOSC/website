Hi everyone,

This Thursday, 2015/09/24 at 7:00PM in Caldwell Labs 120, Patrick Shuff will present "Open Source at Facebook". Description follows:

Facebook serves requests for over 1.3 billion people every month.  I will give a brief overview of our Traffic/CDN (e.g. images and videos) infrastructure and how open source software is core to being able to deliver all of those bits to the world every day!

*Patrick Shuff is a production engineer on the traffic team at Facebook. His team's responsibilities include maintaining/monitoring the global load balancing infrastructure, DNS, and our content delivery platform (i.e. photo/video delivery). Other roles at Facebook include being on the global site reliability team where he, with various infrastructure teams (messaging, real time infrastructure, email), to help increase service reliability and monitoring for their services.*

Laptops are encouraged but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.
