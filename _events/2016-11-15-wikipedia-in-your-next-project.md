title: Wikipedia in your next project
meeting_date: 2016-11-17
---


Kevin Payravi from Wikipedia Connection will present on how to incorporate Wikipedia and its sister projects into your next project. The presentation will explore MediaWiki (the software behind Wikipedia), the MediaWiki API, machine learning and botting with Wikipedia, Wikidata (a free structured knowledgebase), and more. There will be an introduction to Tool Labs, Wikimedia's free hosting environment for Wikimedia projects, as well as a look at some of the cool open source projects that have been developed for Wikipedia - which include vandalism-detecting bots, edit gamification, and making live music out of Wikipedia edits.

This presentation is an official HackOHI/O 2016 pre-hype event - we hope this presentation inspires you to make an awesome Wikimedia-related project at Ohio State's annual hackathon!

Laptops are encouraged, and as always, there will be pizza.
