This talk, geared toward beginners to the world of Unix and Unix-like systems, will cover the absolute basics of getting around and being productive in your Linux environment.

Topics covered should include (but not be limited to):
- basic directory traversal
- file ownership and permissions

Laptops are encouraged but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.
