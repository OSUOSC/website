Alex Fuhr will be giving an intro to open-source hardware and hobby electronics. This talk is designed for those who are entering the Makeathon or who just want to learn more about hardware in general, and will cover topics such as microcontrollers, digit and analog I/O, prototyping tools, serial communication protocols, and potential project ideas.

It's not too late to [sign up for the Makeathon](http://make-oh.io/) this Saturday (March 5th). No matter your level of experience in hardware, you can still make something great.
