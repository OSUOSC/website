Thursday, 2014-11-02 at 7:00pm in Caldwell Lab 120, John Toterhi of Battelle will present "Introduction to Security Concepts."

The talk will be a high level overview of the software security industry and the methods used to find and exploit software vulnerabilities. Topics will include common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), common enumerations and weaknesses (CWE), software fuzzing, reverse engineering, binary diffing, and source code auditing. We'll also talk about the role Capture the Flag (CTF) plays in developing the skills typically used in software security research and the new OSU CTF team.
