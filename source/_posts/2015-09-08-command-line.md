Hi everyone,

This Thursday, September 10 in Caldwell Labs 120, Bobby Reynolds and I will present an Introduction to the Command Line. This talk, given its nature is geared towards beginners. The talk will cover the following:

- how to efficiently navigate directory trees
- basic regex
- how to remove the "french language pack" *cough cough* `rm -fr /`
- file creation, deletion, relocation, etc
- bash aliases
- script execution
- daemons
- how to compile packages from source
- useful one line commands

Laptops are encouraged but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.
