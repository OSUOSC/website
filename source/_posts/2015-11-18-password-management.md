This Thursday, November 19th at 7PM in Caldwell 120, We will discuss the many ways to safe guard/manage your passwords.
Everyone at sometime or another has relied on their browser to store sensitive credentials quite often due to sheer simplicity. Did you know up until 2013 Chromium was storing a user's credentials in PlainText.

Now if your the type that likes to use a password manager, you might already be aware that not all services are created equal. Just this Summer LastPass' security was breached, exposing email accounts, encrypted master passwords, and password hints.

We will also discuss the lesser known solutions such as hardware encrypted HID devices. Just this year the Hack A Day community came together and designed/produced the Mooltipass, an open source hardware encrypted offline password manager.

It's difficult to strike a comparable balance between convenience and security. The intention of this talk is to explore a wide variety of cross-platform solutions to secure your personal data.

Laptops are encouraged but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.
